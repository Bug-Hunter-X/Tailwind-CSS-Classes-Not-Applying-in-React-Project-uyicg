# Tailwind CSS Classes Not Applying in React Project

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using Tailwind CSS in React projects: Tailwind classes not applying correctly.  The problem is that the Tailwind CSS build process may not be configured correctly or the Tailwind directives are missing.

## Bug
The `bug.js` file contains a simple React component that attempts to use Tailwind CSS classes.  However, the classes are not applied, and the component remains unstyled.

## Solution
The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version, showing how to properly configure Tailwind CSS to work with your React project.  Key steps include:
* Ensuring that Tailwind's configuration file (tailwind.config.js) is correctly set up.
* Including the correct `@tailwind` directives in your CSS file.
* Making sure that your build process includes the Tailwind CSS postcss plugin, if one is being used. 
* Importing tailwind directives in your css file

This example highlights the importance of correctly setting up your Tailwind CSS build process to ensure that your classes are applied correctly.
